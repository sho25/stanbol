# DBLP with local index for the Apache Stanbol Entityhub

This module is no longer available. It was replaced by the Indexing Tool for
DBLP that now automatically creates all required resources after the indexing
completes.
 
## Building the DBLP index

The Indexing Tool for DBLP is located at

    {stanbol}/entityhub/indexing/dblp

A detailed documentation on how to use this utility is provided by the
README file.
