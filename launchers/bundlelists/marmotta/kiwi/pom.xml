  <name>Apache Stanbol Marmotta KiWi Repository Bundles</name>
  <description>
    Bundles required by the Apache Marmotta Kiwi Repository. This list includes
    DB drivers for H2 and Postgres and caching dependencies for Guava and Hazelcast.
    Dependencies for other supported options (MySQL, Infinispan, EH Cache) are
    commented. Users that want to use such options will need to create their own
    version of this bundle list or to provide the commented bundles by some
    other means.
