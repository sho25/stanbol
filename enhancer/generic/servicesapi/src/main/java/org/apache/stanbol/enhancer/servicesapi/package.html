<h1>Stanbol Enhancer services API</h1>
<p>
The Stanbol Enhancer services API defines the service interfaces 
for the components that collaborate to implement a Stanbol enhancement
server.
</p>
<p>
See <a href="http://wiki.iks-project.eu/index.php/FISEcodeAndDocs">FISEcodeAndDocs</a> on the IKS wiki
for more information about Stanbol Enhancer (formally called  IKS FISE).
</p>
<p>
The API has almost no external dependencies and is independent
of OSGi or any other components model.
</p>
<p>
It currently has a dependency on the Clerezza MGraph interface,
but we might want to replace that with a more generic "annotations"
interface. 
</p>
<h1>Main design goals</h1>
<p>
The Stanbol enhancement server aims to:
<ul>
<li>
Make it very easy to use it as an external content enhancement/search engine, with a
simple RESTful HTTP interface. Client PUTs or POSTs a piece of content to the 
Stanbol Enhancer, and can then retrieve the enhancements produced by the 
{@link org.apache.stanbol.enhancer.servicesapi.EnhancementEngine}
that are active in the Stanbol Enhancement server, with a GET request.
</li>
<li>
Make it simple for providers of enhancement engines (annotation, geolocation, 
etc...) to plug them into a Stanbol Enhancement server.
With the current implementation, one just needs to implement a new {@link org.apache.stanbol.enhancer.servicesapi.EnhancementEngine} and supply it
as an OSGi service in an OSGi bundle. See the 
<a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/stanbol/trunk/enhancer/engines/autotagging/">Autotagging engine</a>
for an example that wraps a non-OSGi java content enhancement library.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
TODO should we say "annotation" instead of "enhancement", and rename the interfaces
accordingly?
</p>

<h1>Main Stanbol Enhancer use-case</h1>
<p>
To help understand the API, here's an overview of the main Stanbol Enhancer use-case:
<ul>
<li>
Client PUTs or POSTs a piece of content to register it with Enhancer, supplied as a binary 
stream with a Content-Type (and optional initial metadata - not currently implemented).
</li>
<li>
The {@link org.apache.stanbol.enhancer.servicesapi.EnhancementJobManager} goes through its list of 
{@link org.apache.stanbol.enhancer.servicesapi.EnhancementEngine} and
finds out which ones can process the incoming {@link org.apache.stanbol.enhancer.servicesapi.ContentItem}. An engine can suggest
enhancing the content synchronously or assynchronously, and the job manager can override
those suggestions.  
</li>
<li>
The client GETs the {@link org.apache.stanbol.enhancer.servicesapi.ContentItem} using the same URL that it used in the previous
PUT request, or the URL supplied by Enhancer (Location header) if a POST request was used
to register the content.
</li>
<li>
As some enhancement requests might be asynchronous, the returned data might include process
information, for example "3 requests for enhancement still pending".
</li>
</ul>
That's it. Not too hard.
