LD Path support for the Stanbol Enhancer
========================================


Goals for this sub-project:

* RDFBackend implementation over ContentItem: providing access to the metadata, content and additional contentParts that do store RDF data.

* A LD-Path configuration containing default namespaces and functions that ease the selection of knowledge expressed by the Stanbol Enhancement Structure.

See the unit tests for usage examples.
