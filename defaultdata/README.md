# Data files for the default Stanbol distributions

This source repository only holds the pom.xml file and folder structure to build
the org.apache.stanbol.defaultdata artifact to be included in the standard
distributions of stanbol.

To avoid loading subversion repository with large binary files this artifact has
to be build and deployed manually to retrieve precomputed models from other
sites.

## Downloading the OpenNLP statistical model files

Use the `download_models.sh` script.

## Building Entity Hub indices
