 RICK SolrYard Configuration Notes:

 The default Solr multi-core configuration as used by the
 RICK SolrYard.
 By default it defines three cores:
  - entityhub: this is the core used for the EntityhubYard
  - cache: this yard is intended for caches with CacheStrategy "used".
           Multiple SolrYards can used this cache if "Multiple Yard Layout"
           is set to true.
  - test: This core is intended to be used for testing reasons only.
  
  To add additional Cores 
    - create a sub directory with the value configured by instanceDir. 
    - Copy the "conf" Directory of an other core.
    - You can change/optimise the configuration.
