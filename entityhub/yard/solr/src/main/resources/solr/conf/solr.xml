 RICK SolrYard Configuration Notes:

 The default Solr Milti-Core configuration as used by the
 RICK SolrYard.
 By default it defines thre cores:
  - rick: this is the core used for the RickYard
  - cache: this yard is intended for caches with CacheStrategy "used".
           Multiple SolrYards can used this cache if "Multiple Yard Layout"
           is set to true.
  - test: This core is intended to be used for testing reasons only.
  
  To add additional Cores 
    - create a subdirectory with the value configured by instanceDir. 
    - Copy the "conf" Directory of an other core.
    - Do not change the schema.xml because the schema is fixed by the
      SolrYard implementation.
    - You can change/optimize the solrConf.
