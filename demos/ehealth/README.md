Apache Stanbol Demo: eHealth
============================

This module provides a demo on how to customize Apache Stanbol to the ehealth domain.

This demo uses the following datasets:

* __[Dailymed](http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/)__([RDF version](http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/dailymed/))): Published by the National Library of Medicine, this dataset provides high quality information about marketed drugs.
* __[SIDER](http://sideeffects.embl.de/)__([RDF version](http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/sider)): SIDER contains information on marketed drugs and their adverse effects. The information is extracted from public documents and package inserts.
* __[Diseasome](http://www.nd.edu/~networks/Publication%20Categories/03%20Journal%20Articles/Biology/HumanDisease_PNAS-V104-p8685(14My07).pdf)__([RDF version](http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/diseasome)): The human disease network publishes a network of 4,300 disorders and disease genes linked by known disorder-gene associations for exploring all known phenotype and disease gene associations, indicating the common genetic origin of many diseases.
* __[DrugBank](http://www.drugbank.ca/)__([RDF version](http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/drugbank)): A repository of almost 5000 FDA-approved small molecule and biotech drugs. It contains detailed information about drugs including chemical, pharmacological and pharmaceutical data; along with comprehensive drug target data such as sequence, structure, and pathway information.

Note that the RDF versions of this dataset used by this dataset is hosted [by the [Freie Universit√§t Berlin](http://www.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/en/institute/pwo/bizer/)

This demo shows how to

1. import the listed datasets to the Apache Stanbol Entityhub by using the indexing utilities provided by the Stanbol Entityhub. Including the usage examples for 
    * schema mappings during indexing (see "src/main/indexing/config/mappings.txt")
    * customized Apache Solr schemas to control how fields are indexed (see solr core configuration at "src/main/indexing/config/ehealth")
2. "install" the indexed data set - make them available via the Apache Stanbol Entityhub
3. configure the Stanbol Enhancer to extract ehealth related entities
    * based on there labels (fields mapped to rdfs:label)
    * Durgs based on their various IDs (fields mapped to skos:notation)

## Usage

To install the demo you will need to do the following steps

1. execute "__mvn install__": This will create the bundle "org.apache.stanbol.demo.ehealth-*.jar" in the "./target" folder. This bundle includes the configuration for Apache Stanbol Components:
    * Two configurations for the [KeywordLinkingEngine](http://incubator.apache.org/stanbol/docs/trunk/enhancer/engines/keywordlinkingengine.html). One that is configured to extract Entities of the above datasets based on their labels and an other one that is configured to extract Drugs based on their IDs.
    * A special [EnhancementChain](http://incubator.apache.org/stanbol/docs/trunk/enhancer/chains/) for processing ehealt data.
2. execute "__./index.sh__": This shell script automates the steps described in detail by the [Working with local Entities Guide](http://incubator.apache.org/stanbol/docs/trunk/customvocabulary.html). This includes the following steps. 
    * assembly the generic RDF indexing tool ({stanbol}/entityhub/indexing/genericrdf)
    * copy the configuration from "./src/main/indexing/config" to the target directory used for indexing
    * initialize missing configs by calling "java -jar org.apache.stanbol.entityhub.indexing.genericrdf-*-jar-with-dependencies.jar init"
    * download the datasets listed above to "./target/indexing/indexing/resources/rdfdata/"
    * index the datasets
    * copy the results "org.apache.stanbol.data.site.ehealth-1.0.0.jar" and "ehealth.solrindex.zip" to the "./target" folder
3. __Install__ the data to a running Stanbol instance: Both the Stable and the Full launcher can be used as base for this demo. The following steps are required to install the demo
    1. copy "./target/ehealth.solrindex.zip" to "{stanbol-workingdir}/sling/datafils"
    2. install both bundles "./target/org.apache.stanbol.data.site.ehealth-1.0.0.jar" and "./target/org.apache.stanbol.demo.ehealth-*.jar" to your Stanbol instance. Users can use the [Apache Felix Web Console](http://localhost:8080/system/console/bundles)(url: http:{host}:{port}/system/console/bundles) for this task.
    3. wait a minute until Stanbol has installed the data from the "ehealth.solrindex.zip" file


After that the you will be able to 

* use the datasets with the [Stanbol Entityub](http://localhost:8080/entityhub/site/ehealth/)(url: http:{host}:{port}/{alias}/entityhub/site/ehealth)
* extract ehealth related terms by using the [Stanbol Enhancer](http://localhost:8080/enhancer/chain/ehealth) (url: http:{host}:{port}/{alias}/enhancer/chain/ehealth)
