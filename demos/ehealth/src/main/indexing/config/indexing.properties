# Indexing Properties

# Here the name of the dataset MUST be specified by the user
# It MUST BE a single word with no spaces.
name=ehealth

# an optional short description may be used. If missing default descriptions are
# created.
description=ehealth related datasets including Drugbank, Dailymed, SIDER and Diseasome 

# (1) Iterate over Data and lookup scores: (default)

# use the Jena TDB as source for indexing the RDF data located within
# "indexing/resource/rdfdata"
entityDataIterable=org.apache.stanbol.entityhub.indexing.source.jenatdb.RdfIndexingSource,source:rdfdata

#Score Normalizer

# No entity scores available
entityScoreProvider=org.apache.stanbol.entityhub.indexing.core.source.NoEntityScoreProvider

# Different Implementations:
#  - RangeNormaliser: allows to define a range for score values. see
#    "scorerange.properties" for possible configurations
#  - NaturalLogNormaliser: Should be used if the score represents the number of
#    incommings links.
#  - MinScoreNormalizer: allows to prevent indexing of all entities with a score
#    lower than the configured minimum. see "minscore.properties" for possible
#    configurations.

# Entity Processor

# Multiple Entity processors can be used for indexing entities. The are separated by ';'
# and are executed in the order of definition.

# FiledMapperProcessor:
# 
# entityProcessor=org.apache.stanbol.entityhub.indexing.core.processor.FiledMapperProcessor
#
# This processor ensures that "field mappings" are executed while indexing entities.
# By default it will use the mappings configured by the "fieldConfiguraton"
# property. To use other mappings one can use the "mappings" parameter (e.g.
# mappings:otherMappings.txt

# FieldValueFilter
# 
#entityProcessor=org.apache.stanbol.entityhub.indexing.core.processor.FieldValueFilter,config:entityTypes
# 
# This allows to define a field and values that are used to filter entities. Only Entities
# that do have one of the defined values as actual value of the defined field will
# get indexed. This is typically used to filter entities by rdf:type, but can be used
# for any URI property. See the default entityTypes.properties file for more information

# EmptyProcessor
#
#entityProcessor=org.apache.stanbol.entityhub.indexing.core.processor.EmptyProcessor
#
# This processor can be used to deactivate EntityProcessing

# Default Entity Processor configuration
entityProcessor=org.apache.stanbol.entityhub.indexing.core.processor.FieldValueFilter,config:entityTypes;org.apache.stanbol.entityhub.indexing.core.processor.LdpathProcessor,ldpath:ldpath-mapping.txt,append:true;org.apache.stanbol.entityhub.indexing.core.processor.FiledMapperProcessor


# Index Field Configuration

# An index needs to provide its configuration. This is used at runtime if 
# entities are updated.
fieldConfiguration=mappings.txt


# Indexing Destination

# A SolrYard is used as destination for indexing
# To boost some fields (typically labels) one can use the fieldboosts.properties
# A default field boost configuration is provided.
indexingDestination=org.apache.stanbol.entityhub.indexing.destination.solryard.SolrYardIndexingDestination,boosts:fieldboosts


# Additional configurations for ReferencedSite

# The "Synchronized" property is supported by some Entityhub Yard implementations
# to automatically update/delete local data as soon as the created archive with
# the indexed data is updated/deleted in the /datafiles folder of Apache Stanbol
# By default this feature is activated. For very big indexes users might want to
# disable this feature to allow the deletion of the archive after the index was
# initialised successfully.
# By default this feature is enabled. Uncommend the next line to deactivate it.
#Synchronized=false


# All the following properties are optional, but can be used to configure
# the referenced site used to access the indexed data within the Entityhub

# The entity prefixes are used to determine if an entity needs to be searched
# on a referenced site. If not specified requests for any entity will be
# forwarded to this referenced site.
# use ';' to seperate multiple values
org.apache.stanbol.entityhub.site.entityPrefix=http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/drugbank/;http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/dailymed/;http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/sider/;http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/diseasome/;

# Configuration the remote Service
# If the indexed data are also available remotly (e.g. by a Linked data endpoint)
# than it is possible to allow also direct access to such entities
# (a) retrieving entities (access URI and EntityDereferencer implementation)
#org.apache.stanbol.entityhub.site.accessUri="http://example.org/resource"
#org.apache.stanbol.entityhub.site.dereferencerType=
# available EntityDereferencer implementation
# - org.apache.stanbol.entityhub.dereferencer.CoolUriDereferencer
# - org.apache.stanbol.entityhub.dereferencer.SparqlDereferencer

# (b) search entities (queryUri and EntitySearcher implementation)
#org.apache.stanbol.entityhub.site.queryUri=http://example.org/sparql
#org.apache.stanbol.entityhub.site.searcherType=
# available EntitySearcher implementation
# - org.apache.stanbol.entityhub.searcher.SparqlSearcher (generic SPARQL)
# - org.apache.stanbol.entityhub.searcher.LarqSearcher (Larq SPARQL extensions)
# - org.apache.stanbol.entityhub.searcher.VirtuosoSearcher (Virtuoso SPARQL extensions)

# The referenced site can also specify additional mappings to be used in the
# case an entity of this site is imported to the Entityhub.
# Typically the same mappings as used for the indexing are a good start. 
# However one might want to copy some values (e.g. labels) to commonly used
# fields used by the Entityhub
