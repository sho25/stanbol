#Properties and Options used to configure RDF Bridges
#===============================================================================
org.apache.stanbol.cmsadapter.core.mapping.DefaultRDFBridgeImpl.name=Apache Stanbol CMS Adapter Default RDF Bridge Configurations
org.apache.stanbol.cmsadapter.core.mapping.DefaultRDFBridgeImpl.description=This configuration panel allows to configure create bridges between a content repository and RDF data

org.apache.stanbol.cmsadapter.core.mapping.DefaultRDFBridgeImpl.resourceSelector.name=Resource Selector
org.apache.stanbol.cmsadapter.core.mapping.DefaultRDFBridgeImpl.resourceSelector.description=This configuration is used to filter resources from the RDF data. It should have the syntax: rdf:Type > skos:Concept. This configuration states that triples having value skos:Concept of rdf:type</b> predicate will be filtered. And subject of selected triples indicates the resource to be created/updated as node/object in the repository. It is also acceptable to pass full URIs such as http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type > http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#Concept.

org.apache.stanbol.cmsadapter.core.mapping.DefaultRDFBridgeImpl.resourceNamePredicate.name=Resource Name Predicate
org.apache.stanbol.cmsadapter.core.mapping.DefaultRDFBridgeImpl.resourceNamePredicate.description=This configuration indicates the predicate which points to the name of node/object to be created in the repository. It should indicate a single URI such as rdfs:label or http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label. Actually name value is obtained through the triple (s,p,o) where s is one of the subjects filtered by the "Resource Selector" configuration, p is this parameter. This configuration is optional. If an empty configuration is passed name of the CMS objects will be set as the local name of the URI represented by s.
 
org.apache.stanbol.cmsadapter.core.mapping.DefaultRDFBridgeImpl.childrenPredicates.name=Children
org.apache.stanbol.cmsadapter.core.mapping.DefaultRDFBridgeImpl.childrenPredicates.description=This configuration specifies the children of nodes/objects to be created in the repository. Value of this configuration should be like skos:narrower > narrowerObject or skos:narrower > rdfs:label. First option has same logic with the previous parameter. It determines the name of the child CMS object to be created/updated. In the second case, value rdfs:label predicate of resource representing child object will be set as the name of child object/node in the repository. This option would be useful to create hierarchies. It is also possible to set only predicate indicating the subsumption relations such as only skos:narrower. In this case name of the child resource will be obtained from the local name of URI representing this CMS object. This configuration is optional. 

org.apache.stanbol.cmsadapter.core.mapping.DefaultRDFBridgeImpl.defaultChildPredicate.name=Default Child Predicate
org.apache.stanbol.cmsadapter.core.mapping.DefaultRDFBridgeImpl.defaultChildPredicate.description=First of all, this configuration is used only when generating an RDF from the repository. If there are more than one child selector in previous configuration, it is not possible to detect the predicate that will be used as the child assertion. In that case, this configuration is used to set child assertion between parent and child objects. This configuration is optional. But if there is a case in which this configuration should be used and if it is not set, this causes missing assertions in the generated RDF.

org.apache.stanbol.cmsadapter.core.mapping.DefaultRDFBridgeImpl.contentRepositoryPath.name=Content Repository Path
org.apache.stanbol.cmsadapter.core.mapping.DefaultRDFBridgeImpl.contentRepositoryPath.description=This property specifies the content repository path in which the new CMS objects will be created or existing ones will be updated.
