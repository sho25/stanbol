Solr Server Configuration Directory
-----------------------------------

The "solr" directory includes the default configuration of an Solr Server used
with the SolrYard configuration.

Currently this only includes an empty solr.xml file. Because all other
configurations (such as adding Solr cores, copying Solr schemas or whole
Solr indexes - config and data) are handeled internally by the
ManagedSolrServer.S
