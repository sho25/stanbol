Stanbol HTTP Endpoints
======================

The following bundles provide the base infrastructure for building a
consistent set JAX-RS based HTTP endpoints (RESTful webservices) to
publish services implemented by the various OSGi bundles of a Stanbol
distribution.

The general convention is to make each endpoint self-documented by
implementing a @GET annotated method that "Accept: text/html" and return
an HTML page that explains how the endpoint works and give usage examples
with the `curl` commandline tool and HTML forms to quickly test the
service from inside the browser.

- `stanbol/commons/web/base` provides the java interface and OSGi / JAX-RS context
  bridging tooling but not actual JAX-RS resources

- `stanbol/commons/web/home` provides a simple resource for the home page and
  default CSS / icons and base freemarker template to be reused by other Stanbol
  JAX-RS resources for consistent look and feel accross the all documentation.

- `stanbol/commons/web/sparql` provides a sample JAX-RS resource to publish
  access to the registered clerezza triple stores using the standardized SPARQL
  HTTP endpoint API.

TODO: write the documentation to contribute new endpoints that reuse the styling
and menu navigation of the default components.
