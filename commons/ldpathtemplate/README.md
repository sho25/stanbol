LDpath Template
===========

This module exports a LDpath template version compatible with the LDpath version used by Apache Stanbol.

__TODO:__ Remove this module after upgrading LDpath to a version where also ldpath-templage is present in maven central. This is the case for LDpath version >= 0.9.12
