stanbol.enhancer.engine.name.name=Name
stanbol.enhancer.engine.name.description=The name of the enhancement engine as \
used in the RESTful interface '/engine/<name>'

service.ranking.name=Ranking

one with the higher ranking will be used to process parsed content items.

#Properties and Options used to configure 
#===============================================================================
org.apache.stanbol.enhancer.engines.entitycomention.EntityCoMentionEngine.name=Apache \
Stanbol Enhancer Engine: Entity Co-Mention
org.apache.stanbol.enhancer.engines.entitycomention.EntityCoMentionEngine.description=An engine \
that find co-mentions of Entities earlier mentioned on the Text.

enhancer.engines.linking.minSearchTokenLength.name=Min Token Length
enhancer.engines.linking.minSearchTokenLength.description=The minimum \
length of Tokens used to lookup Entities within the Controlled Vocabulary. This parameter is ignored \
in case a POS (Part of Speech) tagger is available for the language of the parsed content.

enhancer.engines.linking.caseSensitive.name=Case Sensitivity
enhancer.engines.linking.caseSensitive.description=Allows to enable/disable \
case sensitive matching

enhancer.engines.linking.properNounsState.name=Link ProperNouns only
enhancer.engines.linking.properNounsState.description=If activated \
only ProperNouns will be matched against the Vocabulary. If deactivated any Noun will be matched. \
NOTE that this parameter requires a tag of the POS TagSet to be mapped against 'olia:PorperNoun'. \
Otherwise mapping will not work as expected.

enhancer.engines.linking.processedLanguages.name=Processed Languages
enhancer.engines.linking.processedLanguages.description=Languages to \
process and optionally language specific configurations. Syntax "{lang};{param-name}={param-value};\
{param-name}={param-value};...". Supported {param-name}s: "lc" - processed Lexical Categories (see \
LexicalCategory enumeration for possible values); "pos" - processed Pos types (see Pos enumeration \
for possible values); "tag" - processed string pos tags; "prob" - minumum probability of pos annotations.

enhancer.engines.linking.defaultMatchingLanguage.name=Default Matching Language
enhancer.engines.linking.defaultMatchingLanguage.description=The language \
used in addition to the language detected for the analysed text to search for Entities. Typically this \
configuration is an empty string to search for labels without any language defined, but for some data \
sets (such as DBpedia.org) that add languages to any labels it might improve resuls to change this \
configuration (e.g. to 'en' in the case of DBpedia.org).

enhancer.engines.comention.adjustExistingConfidence.name=Confidence Adjustment
enhancer.engines.comention.adjustExistingConfidence.description=Used to adjust the \
confidence of existing suggestions for fise:TextAnnotation where a Co-Mention is \
detected by this Engine. Values MUST BE in the range [0..1) (default: 0.33). Setting \
this to 0.0 will deactivate this feature. The {adjusted-confidence} := {confidence} * \
(1 - {value}) .. where {value} is the value configured for this property.
