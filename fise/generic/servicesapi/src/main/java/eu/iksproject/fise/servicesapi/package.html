<h1>FISE services API</h1>
<p>
The FISE services API defines the service interfaces 
for the components that collaborate to implement a FISE
server.
</p>
<p>
See <a href="http://wiki.iks-project.eu/index.php/FISEcodeAndDocs">FISEcodeAndDocs</a> on the IKS wiki
for more information about FISE.
</p>
<p>
The API has almost no external dependencies and is independent
of OSGi or any other components model.
</p>
<p>
It currently has a dependency on the Clerezza MGraph interface,
but we might want to replace that with a more generic "annotations"
interface. 
</p>
<h1>Main design goals</h1>
<p>
The FISE server aims to:
<ul>
<li>
Make it very easy to use it as an external content enhancement/search engine, with a
simple RESTful HTTP interface. Client PUTs or POSTs a piece of content to FISE, and can
then retrieve the enhancements produced by the {@link eu.iksproject.fise.servicesapi.EnhancementEngine}
that are active in the FISE server, with a GET request.
</li>
<li>
Make it simple for providers of enhancement engines (annotation, geolocation, etc...) to plug them into 
a FISE server.
With the current implementation, one just needs to implement a new {@link eu.iksproject.fise.servicesapi.EnhancementEngine} and supply it
as an OSGi service in an OSGi bundle. See the 
<a href="http://iks-project.googlecode.com/svn/sandbox/fise/trunk/engines/autotagging">Autotagging engine</a>
for an example that wraps a non-OSGi java content enhancement library.
</li>
</ul>
TODO should we say "annotation" instead of "enhancement", and rename the interfaces
accordingly?
</p>

<h1>Main FISE use-case</h1>
<p>
To help understand the API, here's an overview of the main FISE use-case:
<ul>
<li>
Client PUTs or POSTs a piece of content to register it with FISE, supplied as a binary 
stream with a Content-Type (and optional initial metadata - not currently implemented).
</li>
<li>
The {@link eu.iksproject.fise.servicesapi.EnhancementJobManager} goes through its list of 
{@link eu.iksproject.fise.servicesapi.EnhancementEngine} and
finds out which ones can process the incoming {@link eu.iksproject.fise.servicesapi.ContentItem}. An engine can suggest
enhancing the content synchronously or assynchronously, and the job manager can override
those suggestions.  
</li>
<li>
The client GETs the {@link eu.iksproject.fise.servicesapi.ContentItem} using the same URL that it used in the previous
PUT request, or the URL supplied by FISE (Location header) if a POST request was used
to register the content.
</li>
<li>
As some enhancement requests might be asynchronous, the returned data might include process
information, for example "3 requests for enhancement still pending".
</li>
</ul>
That's it. Not too hard.
