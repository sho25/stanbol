THE SIGNING
On March 23rd, 2010, the President signed health reform into law, completing a task worked on by seven Presidents before him. He referenced many people had met who had struggled with health care bills and insurance, including his mother, as his motivations for signing the bill.


“Here, in this country, we shape our own destiny. That is what we do. That is who we are. That is what makes us the United States of America. And we have now just enshrined, as soon as I sign this bill, the core principle that everybody should have some basic security when it comes to their health care. –President Obama, 3/23/10
