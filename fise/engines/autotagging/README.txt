This enhancement engine requires a prepared Lucene index that you
can download at:

http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5743203/IKS/autotagging/iks-dbpedia-lucene-idx-20100331-0.tar.bz2

The name of the folder where this index is found must be configured via
the OSGi console (http://localhost:8080/system/console for example),
and you might need to restart the autotagging engine component using
the console after doing so.
